- Cantilever under end load: Compare small displacement Bernoulli Euler solution with Shear deformable solution. Allow to set the shear stiffness individually and see how the two curves converge towards each other.
- Buckling: Remove the moment after the beam has buckled to show that the moments are not needed to keep this state in equilibrium.
