# Computer Lab for **Geometrisch exakte Balkentheorien**

This repository contains the exercise material for the course *Geometrisch exakte Balkentheorien* at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), taught by **Prof. Dr.-Ing. Christoph Meier**.

The exercises are provided as **Jupyter notebooks**, which are intended to be run interactively.

## Running the notebooks online

You can run the notebooks directly in your browser using Binder (no local installation required):

### Notes on using Binder
- When opening a notebook via the Binder link for the first time, the environment may take a few minutes to start.
- The exercises can be opened by navigating to the respective `.ipynb` files in the file browser on the left side.
- Code cells can be executed by selecting a cell and pressing `Shift + Enter`.
- To save your work, download the notebook to your local machine via
  `File > Download`.
- The Binder environment is **temporary** and will reset after a period of inactivity. Make sure to save your work regularly.
